Welcome to the Woo Quality Insights Toolkit (QIT)!

## Who is this toolkit for?

This toolkit is for WooCommerce extension developers that have, or plan to, release extensions in the [Woo Marketplace](https://woocommerce.com/products/). If you have an extension already published, you can start leveraging these tools right away!

## What tools are included?

Currently there are three tools that are provided as part of this toolkit:

- [QIT Dashboard](dashboard/getting-started.md): A UI-based test runner and test results viewer, available in your WooCommerce dashboard.
- [QIT Client](client/getting-started.md): A command line interface (CLI) based tool, which allows for running tests against published and development versions of an extension.
- [QIT GitHub Workflows](workflows/getting-started.md): GitHub workflow files that allow running tests regularly with QIT as part of a GitHub development workflow.

## Why does this toolkit exist?

The primary goal of these tools is to assist extension developers to easily integrate a variety of tests into their development workflows, and promote and encourage quality around WooCommerce extensions available in the marketplace.
