# Getting Started

## Introduction

QIT Local Test Environment allows you to test your projects in an isolated and customizable setting. It's designed for simplicity and flexibility, accommodating both beginner and advanced use cases.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:
- **QIT**: If you haven't already installed the QIT CLI tool, follow the instructions in the [Installation Guide](cli/getting-started.md).
- **Docker**: QIT relies on Docker for creating isolated environments. Make sure Docker is installed and running on your system. [Download Docker here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **PHP**: You need PHP installed on your local machine to interact with QIT's CLI tools. [PHP Installation Guide](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php).

## Setting Up Your First Local Environment

Creating a local test environment with QIT is straightforward:

1. **Start the Environment**: Run `qit env:up` to initiate a basic WordPress environment.
2. **Access Your Site**: Upon completion, you'll receive a URL to access your newly created WordPress instance.
