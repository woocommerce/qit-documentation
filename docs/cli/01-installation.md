### Globally Using Composer

1. Run `composer global require woocommerce/qit-cli`

### Globally Using `wget`

_(Pro Tip: Opting for the Composer installation method simplifies the process of updating QIT in the future ðŸ˜‰)_

1. Run `wget https://github.com/woocommerce/qit-cli/raw/trunk/qit`
2. Execute `chmod +x qit`
3. Move the file to a directory in your PATH, such as `sudo mv qit /usr/local/bin/qit`
4. Run `qit` to authenticate with your Woo.com Partner Developer account.

## Updating QIT

Updating QIT will depend on how you installed it.

### If you installed it per-project:

1. Run `composer update woocommerce/qit-cli`

### If you installed it globally using Composer:

1. Go to your global composer directory `cd $(composer global config bin-dir --absolute)`
2. Run `composer update woocommerce/qit-cli`

#### If you installed it with `wget`:

1. Delete the old binary `which qit` then `rm` it.
2. Repeat the installation steps.
