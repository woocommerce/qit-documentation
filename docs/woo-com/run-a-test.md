On this page, you can configure the type of test to run, the product to run the tests against, and which release version:

Once you've selected the type of test you'd like to run, the product to run it against, and the release version, click the `Confirm and run test` button at the bottom to queue up the test to be ran:

Once the test has been queued up, you'll be redirected to the All Tests page and will see a success notification that the test has been created:

![test-created-notification](_media/test-created-notification.png)

Note that it may take a moment before the test shows in the table. You can refresh the page or wait for the table to automatically refresh.

The test will then be displayed in the table, showing the version of the extension, the selected test type, the selected WooCommerce Release version with a `Pending` status:
