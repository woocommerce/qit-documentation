# Managed tests

Managed tests are a series of tests written and maintained by QIT.

All of these tests are available for you out-of-the-box, and they work with any WordPress plugin or theme.

## Managed tests vs. custom E2E tests

While the managed tests are written and maintained by us, the custom E2E tests are written and maintained by you.

The managed tests are designed to cover the most common use cases and scenarios, but they may not cover all the specific use cases of your plugin or theme.

If you have specific use cases that are not covered by the managed tests, you can write your own custom E2E tests and run them using QIT.
