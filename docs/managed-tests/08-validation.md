# Validation Tests

Our validation test is designed to inform you of any issues with plugin and theme metadata. Right now it is purely informative, but in the future it may block submissions or updates.

## Types of Issues Flagged
The presence and value of certain headers will be checked:

- `Requires PHP` - warning if not present in main plugin or theme file.
- More coming soon!

## What to do if it fails

If your validation test is failing, please review the following steps:
- Open the test report.
- Identify the causes of the failure (typically a missing or misspelled header) and remedy it.
- If you believe you've run across a bug in the test, please email us at qit@woocommerce.com so we can review and make the necessary adjustments.
